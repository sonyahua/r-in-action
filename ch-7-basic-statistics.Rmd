```

For the examples, we'll be using the data set mtcars
A data frame with 32 observations on 11 variables.

[, 1]	 mpg	 Miles/(US) gallon
[, 2]	 cyl	 Number of cylinders
[, 3]	 disp	 Displacement (cu.in.)
[, 4]	 hp	 Gross horsepower
[, 5]	 drat	 Rear axle ratio
[, 6]	 wt	 Weight (1000 lbs)
[, 7]	 qsec	 1/4 mile time
[, 8]	 vs	 V/S
[, 9]	 am	 Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
[,10]	 gear	 Number of forward gears
[,11]	 carb	 Number of carburetors

### 7.1 Descriptive Statistics


```{r}
data(mtcars)

# Method 1: summary()

myvars <- c("mpg", "hp", "wt")
summary(mtcars[myvars])
```
`sapply` used for matrices
```{r}
# Method 2: Define own functions and use sapply

mystats <- function(x, na.omit=F) {
  if (na.omit)
    x <- x[!is.na(x)]  # if we want to omit NA's
  m <- mean(x)
  n <- length(x)
  s <- sd(x)
  skew <- sum((x-m)^3/s^3)/n
  kurt <- sum((x-m)^3/s^4)/n -3
  return(c(n=n, mean=m, standard.dev=s, skew=skew, kurtosis=kurt))
}

sapply(mtcars[myvars],mystats)

# Another example

centralstats <- function(x, na.omit=F) {
  if (na.omit)
    x <- x[!is.na(x)]
  m <- mean(x)
  med <- median(x)
  mode <- mode(x)
  return(c(mean=m, median=med, mode=mode))
}

sapply(mtcars[myvars], centralstats)
```

The `describe()` function in the `Hmisc` package returns the number of variables and observations, the number of missing and unique values, and the five highest/lowest values

```{r}
# Method 3: Describe() from hmisc pkg

#install.packages("Hmisc")
library(Hmisc)
sdata <- mtcars[myvars]

describe(sdata)
```

For `stat.desc()`, if `norm=T`, normal distribution statistics are returned including skewness, kurtosis, their p-values, and the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality. The Shapiroâ€“Wilk test tests the null hypothesis that a sample x1, ..., xn came from a normally distributed population. 
```{r}
# Method4: stat.desc() from pastecs pkg

#install.packages("pastecs")
library(pastecs)
stat.desc(sdata, norm=T)
```
*Obs:* We fail to reject the null hypothesis that mpg and wt comes from a normally distributed population. This suggests mpg and wt are normally distributed, but not hp. 

Kernal density plots are usually a much more effective way to view the distribution of a variable. Create the plot using plot(density(x)) where x is a numeric vector.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(density(sdata$mpg, bw=4))
plot(density(sdata$wt, bw=4))
plot(density(sdata$hp, bw=4))
```
```{r}
#install.packages("psych")
library(psych)
describe(sdata)
```
*bs:* All variables are positively skewed to the left. There is a flatter distribution for MPG than there is for wt.

*Skewness *is a measure of symmetry, or more precisely, the lack of symmetry. A distribution, or data set, is symmetric if it looks the same to the left and right of the center point. 

*Kurtosis* is a measure of whether the data are heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution.

There are 2 versions of `describe()` based on packages Hmisc and psych. To specify which package to use do: `Hmisc::describe(sdata)`

### 7.1.3 Descriptive Stats by Group

We can usage `aggregate()` for single functions and `by=list(am=mtcars$am)` to specify we want a caolumn called `am` and the means to be grouped by this column

```{r}

mtcars
aggregate(sdata, by=list(am=mtcars$am), mean)

aggregate(sdata,by=list(am=mtcars$am), sd)
```
*Obs:* Automatic transmissions are much slower and have less horsepower than manual transmissions. It's also heavier than manual.
